    You are a skilled political speech writer tasked with creating a personalized, compelling speech for
    a political candidate. Your goal is to craft a persuasive speech that resonates with the target
    audience while authentically representing the candidate's values, policies, and personality.

    ## Candidate Information

    User prompt is the detailed information about the candidate. Carefully analyze this data as it contains
    all the necessary information to create a tailored speech:
    <candidate_data>
    {$CANDIDATE_DATA}
    </candidate_data>


    ## Speech Creation Process

    ### Step 1: Analyze the Candidate Data
    - Extract and organize key information from the candidate data including:
    - Name, party affiliation, and office sought
    - Biographical information and professional background
    - Key strengths and policy positions
    - Target demographic and their primary concerns
    - Cultural context and values
    - Campaign slogan and main message
    - Speech parameters (length, type, tone, language)

    ### Step 2: Structure the Speech
    Create a speech with the following structure:
    1. **Powerful Opening**: Begin with a greeting appropriate to the cultural context, followed by a
    compelling statement that captures attention.
    2. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the candidate and establish credibility.
    3. **Vision Statement**: Clearly articulate the candidate's vision using the main message.
    4. **Policy Points**: Address 3-5 key policy areas from the "policy-points" and "primary-concerns"
    fields.
    5. **Personal Connection**: Include a personal story or connection that humanizes the candidate.
    6. **Addressing Challenges**: Acknowledge challenges and present solutions.
    7. **Call to Action**: End with a strong call to action based on the "cta-instructions" field.

    ### Step 3: Apply the Appropriate Style and Tone
    - Match the speech tone to the specified "speech-tone" (authoritative, conversational,
    inspirational, etc.)
    - Incorporate the requested rhetorical devices
    - Maintain the specified level of formality
    - Use language appropriate for the target demographic's education level and age range
    - Include cultural references relevant to the specified cultural context

    ### Step 4: Incorporate Persuasive Elements
    - Use the "story-elements" to create compelling narratives
    - Reference recent events mentioned in the data
    - Address the concerns of the target demographic
    - Emphasize the candidate's strengths and unique selling points
    - Incorporate the campaign slogan naturally throughout the speech

    ### Step 5: Ensure Cultural and Political Sensitivity
    - Respect the cultural beliefs and values mentioned
    - Consider the political climate when discussing controversial topics
    - Use inclusive language that appeals to all mentioned communities
    - Incorporate appropriate references to religious or cultural traditions if specified

    ## Speech Format Requirements

    - Create a speech that can be delivered in the specified time frame (calculate approximately 130
    words per minute)
    - Use the specified language/dialect
    - Format the speech with clear paragraph breaks and natural pauses
    - Include stage directions in [brackets] for emphasis, pauses, or gestures where appropriate
    - If the "language-dialect" includes code-switching between languages, incorporate this naturally

    ## Examples of Effective Speech Elements

    - **Powerful opening**: "My fellow citizens, today we stand at the crossroads of our nation's
    future..."
    - **Personal connection**: "Like many of you, I grew up in a family that valued hard work and
    sacrifice..."
    - **Policy introduction**: "Let me share with you three commitments I make to every citizen of this
    district..."
    - **Effective call to action**: "On [election date], you have the power to choose a path of security
    and prosperity..."

    ## Final Output

    Present the complete speech in a clean, readable format. The speech should:
    - Be the appropriate length for the specified time
    - Authentically represent the candidate's voice and values
    - Address the primary and secondary objectives
    - Do not create hypothetical stories, use just the given context and user parameters

"candidate-name": "Narendra Modi",
"political-party": "Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)",
"other-party": "Indian National Congress, Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS)",
"office-sought": "Prime Minister of India",
"bio": "Narendra Damodardas Modi[a] (born 17 September 1950)[b] is an Indian politician who
has served as the prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat
from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a far-right
Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister
outside the Indian National Congress.[4]

Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his
secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. At the age of 18, he
was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging
her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the
RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he rose through the
party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in 1998.[c] In 2001, Modi was appointed chief
minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is
considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of
the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of
whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[13] A Special
Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to
initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were
credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to
significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f]

In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a
party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending
on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation
campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of
banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy.

Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training
camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[16][17] but the action had nationalist appeal.[18] Modi's
party won the 2019 general election which followed.[19] In its second term, his administration
revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,[20][21] and introduced the Citizenship
Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which
Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[22][23][24] Three controversial farm laws led
to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw
India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health
Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died.[25][26] In the 2024 general election, Modi's
party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the
National Democratic Alliance coalition.[27][28]

Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of
democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[29][30][g] As prime
minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[36][37][38] Modi has been
described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a
controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and
handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and
exclusionary social agenda.[h]",

    "speech": "Namaskaram, Warangal! Mee andariki na hrudayapoorvaka vandanalu!\nMy dear brothers and sisters of this historic city of Warangal, today, I stand before you in this ancient land of the Kakatiyas, where every stone tells a story of greatness. Just as the magnificent Warangal Fort has stood the test of time, the spirit of this region remains unbroken and strong. When I look at Warangal, I see not just a city with a glorious past, but a center with unlimited potential for the future. The same hands that created the intricate carvings of the Thousand Pillar Temple can now weave the fabric of a new India. The same soil that nurtured the Kakatiya dynasty can now nurture a new generation of entrepreneurs, farmers, and innovators.\nFor over a decade as Prime Minister and before that as Chief Minister of Gujarat, I have worked with a single vision: \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas\" - Together with all, Development for all, Trust of all. This is not just a slogan; it is our sacred commitment to every citizen of India, including each one of you in Warangal.\nThe weavers of Warangal are known across the world for their artistic brilliance. Your handlooms tell stories that words cannot express. But I understand the challenges you face. That is why our government has initiated special programs to modernize the textile industry while preserving your unique traditional skills. We will establish a Textile Park here in Warangal that will connect your extraordinary craftsmanship directly to global markets. Just as threads come together to create beautiful fabric, we must weave together tradition and technology to create prosperity.\nFor our farmers who toil in the fields of Telangana, we have doubled the budget for agriculture. Our PM-KISAN scheme ensures direct financial support, and we are working to improve irrigation facilities across the region. The fertile lands of Telangana deserve the best support, and we are committed to providing it.\nYoung friends, I understand your aspirations. You want quality education and meaningful employment. That is why we are expanding educational institutions in Telangana. We will establish a new center of excellence in Warangal focused on emerging technologies, ensuring that the youth of this region are at the forefront of India's technological revolution. The ancient fort of Warangal attracts visitors from across the country. But we want the world to witness its splendor. We will develop a comprehensive heritage tourism circuit connecting Warangal Fort, Ramappa Temple, and other historical sites. This will not only preserve your cultural heritage but also create thousands of jobs in the tourism sector.\nI remember when I was young, I traveled across our great nation, visiting places like Warangal. I was struck by the richness of our heritage and the warmth of our people. Those journeys shaped my vision for India—a vision where every region preserves its unique identity while moving forward on the path of development. This is not just a political commitment; it is personal for me.\nBrothers and sisters, infrastructure is the backbone of development. We are investing in expanding road networks, improving railway connectivity, and enhancing digital infrastructure. Soon, Warangal will be connected to major economic centers through high-speed corridors, opening new avenues for growth and prosperity. I know there are challenges. The competition from mass-produced textiles threatens your traditional crafts. Water scarcity affects your agriculture. Limited industrial development has restricted job opportunities. But for every challenge, we have a solution. Our government will provide special incentives for handloom products, implement water conservation projects, and establish skill development centers to create employment opportunities.\nSome people ask why the BJP should be trusted in Telangana. I ask them to look at our track record. Wherever we have been given the opportunity to serve, we have delivered development without discrimination. Our only religion is \"India First,\" our only holy book is the Constitution of India, and our only focus is the welfare of 1.4 billion Indians.\nFriends, I ask you this: Can a nation progress if some regions are left behind? Can we claim to be developed if cities like Warangal do not realize their full potential? The answer is clear. The journey of India's development cannot be complete without the development of Telangana, and the development of Telangana cannot be complete without the transformation of historic cities like Warangal.\nToday, I ask for your support not just for the BJP but for a vision that sees Warangal as a model city that perfectly blends its rich heritage with modern development. A city where tradition and technology walk hand in hand. A city that honors its past while embracing the future.\nLet us work together to build a Warangal where our heritage sites become world-class tourist destinations, our weavers receive the recognition and rewards they deserve, our farmers prosper with modern agricultural practices, our youth find quality education and employment opportunities, and our infrastructure supports rapid economic growth. This is not just a dream; it is a roadmap that we will follow with unwavering determination. With your support, we will transform Warangal into a shining example of development that respects tradition.\nI invite each one of you to become ambassadors of change. Speak to your friends, your families, your communities about the vision we share for Warangal and Telangana. Together, we can build a future that makes every resident of this great city proud.\nWarangal ki jai! Telangana ki jai! Bharat Mata ki jai!\nThank you, and may the blessings of the Kakatiyas be with you all.",

1970) is an Indian politician. A member of the Indian National Congress (INC), he is currently
serving as the 12th leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha and as the member of the Lok Sabha
for Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, since June 2024.[c][d] He previously represented the
constituency of Wayanad, Kerala, from 2019 to 2024, and Amethi, Uttar Pradesh, from 2004 to
2019. Gandhi served as the party president of the Indian National Congress from December
2017 to July 2019.
A member of the Nehru–Gandhi political family, he spent his early years between Delhi and
Dehradun, remaining largely outside the public sphere during his childhood and early youth. He
received primary education in New Delhi and then attended The Doon School. However, due to
security concerns, he was later home-schooled. Gandhi commenced his undergraduate degree
at St. Stephen's College before moving to Harvard University. Following his father's
assassination and subsequent security concerns, he moved to Rollins College in Florida,
completing his degree in 1994. After earning a M.Phil. from Cambridge, Gandhi initiated his
professional career with the Monitor Group, a management consulting firm in London. Soon
thereafter, he returned to India and founded Backops Services Private Ltd, a technology
outsourcing firm based in Mumbai. He ventured into politics in the 2000s, leading the Indian

Youth Congress and National Students Union of India, while also being a trustee of the Rajiv
Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust.
Gandhi led the Congress party during the 2014 and 2019 general elections, where the party
experienced significant defeats, securing 44 and 52 seats, respectively. Ahead of the 2024
Indian general elections, Gandhi spearheaded the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay
Yatra, contributing to the INC winning 99 seats and regaining the status of Official Opposition for
the first time in a decade. Gandhi won the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency in the 2024
elections and was nominated to serve as Leader of the Opposition.",

    "speech": "Nyay For All - Building a Just and Inclusive Warangal\n\nNamaskaram, my dear brothers and sisters of Warangal!\nToday, as I stand before you in this historic city that has witnessed centuries of struggle and triumph, I am filled with hope and determination. Warangal has always been at the forefront of movements for justice – from the Telangana liberation struggle to the fight for statehood. This spirit of resilience is what makes your city special.\n\nI am Rahul Gandhi, and I come to you not just as a representative of the Indian National Congress, but as someone who shares your dreams for a better future. Like many of you, I believe in an India where everyone has equal opportunities, where a farmer's child has the same chance to succeed as anyone else.\n\nMy vision for Warangal is simple yet powerful – to create a community where every citizen has equal opportunities, social protection, and a voice in shaping their future. This is what \"Nyay For All\" truly means.\n\nThe challenges facing Warangal today are significant. Our farmers struggle with mounting debts and uncertain markets. I have met farmers here who work tirelessly yet cannot guarantee their children's education. This must change. Under our farm loan waiver program, we will ensure that no farmer in Warangal lives under the crushing weight of debt. We will establish guaranteed minimum support prices and create modern irrigation systems that benefit all farmers, not just the wealthy few.\n\nEmployment opportunities for our youth remain scarce. In my interactions across Telangana, I've met brilliant young graduates forced to migrate because they cannot find work in their hometowns. Our commitment is to generate 22 lakh government jobs within one year of coming to power, with special provisions for the youth of Warangal. Beyond government jobs, we will create an ecosystem where entrepreneurship thrives, where small businesses receive the support they need to grow and create more opportunities.\n\nHealthcare remains a distant dream for many. Just last month, I met a tribal family from the outskirts of Warangal who sold their only piece of land to pay for emergency medical treatment. No family should have to choose between health and livelihood. We will expand healthcare access through a network of well-equipped primary health centers in every mandal of Warangal, ensuring quality healthcare becomes a right, not a privilege.\n\nThe tribal communities of Warangal, who have been the true custodians of our forests and natural resources, continue to be marginalized. Our tribal rights protection initiative will safeguard your land rights, cultural heritage, and ensure your participation in development programs that affect your communities.\n\nLet me share something personal with you. During my Bharat Jodo Yatra, I walked alongside a group of women weavers from Warangal. They shared their stories of struggle, resilience, and hope. One weaver, Lakshmi, told me how her family has preserved traditional techniques for generations despite economic hardships. Her determination inspired me. It reminded me that our strength lies in our diversity and traditions. The Congress party's women's empowerment initiatives will provide special support to these artisans, ensuring their skills and traditions not only survive but thrive in the modern economy.\n\nI recognize that we face an uphill battle. Some political parties promise development that benefits only a select few. Others make grand promises that they never intend to keep. The difference with Congress is that we believe in inclusive growth – development that lifts everyone, not just those at the top.\n\nOur Universal Basic Income program will ensure that the poorest 20% of households in Warangal receive direct financial assistance to meet their basic needs. Our educational scholarship program will make quality education accessible to every child, regardless of their family's financial situation.\n\nFriends, the path ahead is not easy, but nothing worthwhile ever is. The struggle for justice is ongoing. When my father spoke of the 21st century belonging to India, he envisioned an India where progress means prosperity for all – not just economic indicators that look good on paper while people continue to suffer.\n\nThis is why I ask you to join hands with the Congress to build a more equitable and just Warangal. Your participation is crucial – in community welfare programs, in raising your voice against injustice, and in supporting candidates who prioritize social justice over personal gain.\n\nOn election day, when you cast your vote, remember that you are not just choosing a representative – you are choosing a vision for Warangal's future. A vision where farmers prosper, youth find meaningful employment, tribal communities thrive, and women lead with confidence.\n\nTogether, we can build a Warangal that honors its rich heritage while embracing a progressive future. A Warangal where justice is not just a word, but a lived reality for all citizens.\n\nJai Hind! Jai Telangana!",

the crisis. According to official records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of
whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[13] A Special
Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to
initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were
credited for encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for failing to
significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f]
In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a
party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and reduced spending

on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation
campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. His demonetisation of
banknotes in 2016 and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax in 2017 sparked controversy.
Modi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training
camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[16][17] but the action had nationalist appeal.[18] Modi's
party won the 2019 general election which followed.[19] In its second term, his administration
revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir,[20][21] and introduced the Citizenship
Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which
Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs.[22][23][24] Three controversial farm laws led
to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw
India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which, according to the World Health
Organization's estimates, 4.7 million Indians died.[25][26] In the 2024 general election, Modi's
party lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government leading the
National Democratic Alliance coalition.[27][28]
Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of
democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[29][30][g] As prime
minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[36][37][38] Modi has been
described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a
controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and
handling of the Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and
exclusionary social agenda.[h]",

    "speech": "Namaskaram, mere pyaare Warangal ke bhaiyon aur behno!\nToday I stand before you in this historic city of Warangal - the glorious land that once served as the capital of the mighty Kakatiya dynasty. This sacred soil has witnessed centuries of valor, cultural richness, and architectural brilliance. When I visited the magnificent Warangal Fort and stood before the Ramappa Temple, recently recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, I felt the pulse of Telangana's glorious past and envisioned its even more magnificent future.\nMy dear friends, I am Narendra Modi, and I come to you with the promise of transforming dreams into reality. For the past decade, we have worked tirelessly to build a new India - an India that honors its past while embracing its future. Today, I ask you to join this journey of transformation for Telangana.\nOur vision is clear - Viksit Bharat, Viksit Telangana. A developed India with a developed Telangana at its heart. This is not just a slogan; it is our solemn commitment to you.\nThe farmers of Warangal have nourished this land with their sweat and determination. Yet today, I see your struggles with irrigation and fair prices for your produce. Under BJP's leadership, we will complete all pending irrigation projects within a strict timeline, bringing water to every farm. We will implement a comprehensive agricultural reform package that guarantees minimum support prices and introduces modern farming techniques that increase your yields while reducing your costs.\nI still remember meeting a farmer from a village near Warangal who told me how his father and grandfather had tilled the same land, using the same methods, facing the same challenges. This cycle of struggle must end. Our Kisan Samman Nidhi will be strengthened and expanded specifically for Telangana's unique agricultural needs.\nThe youth of Warangal deserve opportunities that match their talents and ambitions. Our skill development initiative will establish centers of excellence across Warangal, providing training that directly connects to job opportunities. We will create an industrial corridor that attracts investments and generates employment right here, so that our youth don't need to leave their homes and families to find work.\nThe rich cultural heritage of Warangal is not just a source of pride but also a powerful economic engine. We will develop a heritage tourism circuit connecting the Kakatiya-era monuments, creating thousands of jobs while preserving your cultural identity. The Ramappa Temple will become the centerpiece of this cultural renaissance, attracting visitors from across India and around the world.\nWhen I look at Warangal, I don't see just what it is today - I see what it can become tomorrow. A city where ancient glory meets modern infrastructure. Where farmers prosper, youth find meaningful employment, and every citizen has access to quality healthcare and education.\nSome people will tell you that this is just another speech, just another promise. But look at our track record. From the cleanliness of our cities through Swachh Bharat to the dignity of a home through PM Awas Yojana, from the security of health coverage through Ayushman Bharat to the empowerment of women through Mudra loans - we don't just make promises, we deliver them.\nWhile others have treated Telangana as merely a political battlefield, we see it as an integral part of our national development story. The parties that have ruled this state have failed to address your fundamental concerns. They have been busy fighting among themselves while you wait for basic needs to be met.\nBrothers and sisters of Warangal, the time for change has come. The choice before you is clear - continue with unfulfilled promises or embrace a new era of development and cultural pride.\nI urge each one of you to become an ambassador for change. Speak to your friends and family about our vision for Warangal and Telangana. Help register new voters who believe in development rather than division. Volunteer your time and energy to spread our message of hope and progress.\nOn election day, when you press the lotus button, you are not just voting for a party or a candidate. You are voting for a vision that honors your past and secures your future. You are voting for irrigation canals that will water your fields, for skills that will empower your children, for hospitals that will care for your families, and for a cultural renaissance that will make Warangal shine once again on the world stage.\nTogether, we will build a Viksit Telangana that stands tall and proud in a Viksit Bharat. A Telangana where the glory of the Kakatiyas isn't just a historical memory but a living inspiration for development and progress.\nJai Telangana! Jai Hind!",
